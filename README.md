On-Board-Diagnostics-System using OBD-2

Many automobile drivers are aware of the driving behaviors and habits that can lead to inefficient and unsafe driving. 
However, it is often the case that these same drivers unknowingly exhibit these inefficient and unsafe driving behaviors in 
their everyday driving activity and technical details for evaluation of Real Time Car Monitoring.
This project proposes a practical and economical way to capture / measure / evaluate inefficient, uneconomical 
and unsafe driving with the details about Performance, Diagnostics (Using Diagnostics Trouble Code - DTC), 
Fuel Consumption & Autonomy and Emission from a Vehicle. 
The proposed solution consists of a mobile application, running on an Android Smartphone, paired with a compatible 
OBD-II (On-board diagnostics II) reader.
